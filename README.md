# Getting started with Github and Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

Instructions for getting started with github and Visual Studio Code. 

This repo covers downloading and installing Visual Studio Code, a text editor that makes working with github easy (in my experience - your mileage may differ!), and the basics of creating your first repo. 

This repo functions as a short tutorial for anyone who has some experience in bioinformatics and wants to use github for saving and/or sharing their work. It will cover some basics, but is not (anywhere near) exhaustive. 

You will need a github account (https://github.com/).
